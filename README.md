### Hi 👋 I'm Hasan Berke Ateştemur, a student based in Istanbul, Turkey.

I'm a sophomore studying **Statistics** at **Yıldız Technical University**. Currently, I am exploring the intriguing intersection of **Cybersecurity** and **Artificial Intelligence**, dedicating my time to research and self-improvement in these fields. I also enjoy sharing what I learn; recently, I've been writing about **Rust** on Medium.

When I'm not studying or coding, I'm probably engaging with **cinema**—watching and writing critiques about films—or playing my **electric guitar**.
